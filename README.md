## Features

- **FIFO Trash Management**: Automatically deletes the oldest files first to maintain the trash size within the specified limit.
- **User-Defined Trash Size**: Allows users to set a maximum size for the trash directory.

## How It Works

1. **FIFO Rule**: The application monitors the trash directory and deletes the oldest files first when the total size exceeds the user-defined limit.
2. **Configurable Trash Size**: Users can specify the maximum size for the trash directory. The app will ensure that the total size of files in the trash does not exceed this limit.

## Usage

1. **Set Trash Size**: Define the maximum size for your trash directory in the app settings.
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: The app will automatically manage the trash directory, deleting the oldest files first to keep the total size within the specified limit.
